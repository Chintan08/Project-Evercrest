Here's how this works:

Effects have three methods:

Initial Effect
A constant effect, that gets called on every round. Effect duration is subtracted here.
After duration is over, a revert method is called to revert the effects.

Cooldown is handled through the effect itself, not through combat
All combat does is applies effects to a list and calls on the constant.

Effects are not hard coded; this means that each individual ability can apply its own unique version of an effect.
Ex: Ability A calls on Burn, and gives it a damage value of 5. Ability B calls on Burn, and gives it a damage value of 10. These are two different effects.
