# Project-Evercrest

Project Evercrest is a terminal RPG based on the lore from the world of Evercrest.

Project Evercrest tries to make a world, comparable to Skyrim, in text. The game is meant to have a lot of content, and tries to be immersive through it's story telling and choices the player can make.

Current TODO list:

- Add all races
- Complete the Wilds of Stronia, including bosses and enemies and their drops
- Complete all Ability Master quests
- Add many tinier quests and bigger quests to Bjorne
- Add all intended items to the Market
- Add all intended crafting recipes
- Add enough item sets for Stronia specifically
- Add all Stronia specific abilities
- Balance out all stats

This project repository is currently depracated. It is being replaced with Project Evercrest 2, with the major change being UI implementation.
